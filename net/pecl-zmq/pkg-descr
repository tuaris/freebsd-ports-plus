ZeroMQ (zmq) is a PHP extension that provides bindings for the ZeroMQ
messaging library. ZeroMQ is a high-performance asynchronous messaging
library aimed at use in distributed or concurrent applications.

This port builds from the GitHub master branch which includes fixes for
PHP 8.0 through 8.4, beyond the last PECL release (1.1.3, 2016).
